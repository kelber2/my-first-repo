- Pound signs (#, ##) make headings.

- A word surrounded by single asterisks (*word*) makes that word italicized.

- A word surrounded by double asterisks (**word**) makes that word bold.

- You can create lists with hyphens (-) or numbers (1., 2., 3.).

- Code can be placed in the middle of a line with single backticks (`code`).

- A code block can be created by putting code in between a set of triple backticks (```).

- You can insert a link with brackets and parentheses ([Link text here](http://jhu.edu)).

- You can use an image with an exclamation point, and a link to an image (![Alt text here](http://jhu.edu/jeff.jpg))
